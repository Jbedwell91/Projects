After studying all of the items, you will be prompted to recall each definition by typing it into a short answer box. You will then answer a brief quesion and indicate the degree to which you think your answer is correct. Please do not write anything down, do not click the back button on your browser, and do not open other tabs or browsers during the experiment. Thank you for your participation!
